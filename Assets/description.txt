The goal of the task is to create a panel displaying data provided by the ServerMock class.

There are up to 5 elements on the panel at the same time. When the scene starts, the first 5 should be displayed.
"NEXT", "PREVIOUS" buttons allow navigation and showing subsequent elements (in steps of 5 elements)

Elements have three categories (RED, GREEN, BLUE). Some of them may be marked as special and should then be highlighted.
The data does not change during program execution.
